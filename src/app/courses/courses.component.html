      Students write sample programs in some of the languages studied. The languages are used to illustrate programming
      language constructs such as binding, binding times, data types and implementation, operations (assignment
      data-type creation, pattern matching), data control, storage management, parameter passing, and operating
      environment. The suitability of these various languages for particular programming tasks is also covered.</p>

      course. The student receives regularly scheduled supervision from the faculty instructor.</p>


    <h3>Special Topics in Computer Science - Natural Language Processing</h3>
    <h5><i>Spring 2019, CSE 392</i></h5>
    <p>This course will introduce the algorithms and statistical techniques used for natural language processing,
      covering syntax (identifying structure), semantics (uncovering meaning), and applications (e.g. sentiment
      analysis, machine translation, and human language analysis). Students will be introduced to techniques in modern
      machine learning that power state-of-the-art NLP: deep learning (recursive neural networks, transformers) as well
      as discriminative learning (ridge regression, logistic regression). The course will have a substantial project

    <p>This course deals with the impact of computers on us as individuals and on our society. Rapid changes in
      computing technology and in our use of that technology have changed the way we work, play, and interact with other
      people. These changes have created a flood of new social and legal issues that demand critical examination. For
      example, technologies such as Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, along with music sharing sites and wikis create new
      social, ethical, and legal issues.</p>


    <h3>Technical Communications</h3>

    <p>Principles of professional technical communications for Computer Science and Information Systems majors. Topics
      include writing business communications, user manuals, press releases, literature reviews, and research abstracts.
      Persuasive oral communications and effective presentation techniques, to address a range of audiences, will also
      be covered.</p>

    <h3>Scripting Languages</h3>
    <h5><i>Fall 2018, CSE 337</i></h5>
    <p>Scripting languages are widely used in the IT industry. Programming with scripting languages, also known as
      scripting, has several advantages compared to programming with other types of languages in that scripts facilitate
      rapid program development; can automate high-level jobs or tasks very effectively; and can be used to compose
      various software components, even binaries, into more complex and powerful applications. This course introduces
      the principles of scripting, covers one or two selected scripting languages in depth, and illustrates the advanced
      use of scripting by extensive case studies in application areas such as system administration, web application
      development, graphical user interface development, and text processing.</p>
