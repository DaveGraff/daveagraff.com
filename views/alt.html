		<p>My name is David Graff. I’m a student at SUNY Stony Brook studying Computer Science. I expect to graduate in May of 2020. In the past three years I’ve worked with Bash, C, CSS and HTML, Git, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python(Flask), MIPS Assembly, and MySQL - with a focus in Java and Git.</p>
        <p>I currently work in Stony Brook's Teaching Learning Lab as a Student Assistant/Coder. I hope to one day become a software engineer and help solve real world problems.</p>
        <p>I enjoy making new things, and I've also been fascinated by machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
